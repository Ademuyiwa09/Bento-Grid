## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS

### Continued development

This is my first time using SASS and it was unbelievable easier to use. I think I prefer SASS over CSS because it has a lot of features especially when working with the DRY principles.

### Useful resources

- [SASS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a5j7KoflTs&list=PPSV) - This helped me in learning CSS-Preprocessors. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
